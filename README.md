# random-mod
This is a mod for Mindustry that adds an assortment of "random", but useful stuff to the game.
In this mod, I am aiming to add turrets, real world stuff like tanks, nuclear weaponry, oil power generators, trebucet, and more, in the future. I do want to keep all the stuff I would like to do in one mod to make it simple, in terms of amount of mods, even though a good portion of the things that may go into the mod may not make sense to add together.
Plans: make oil to power generation; oil to fuel, fuel can be used as another type of fluid in wave/tsunami, fuel to power generation; add nuclear weapons, like ICBM; add trebucet, catapult, ballista as a "different" type of seige weapon; tanks/planes/boats, like from WWI, WWII, and modern era as units; add some or all of periodic table of elements slowly and steadily; and who knows what else may come later.
