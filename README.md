# random-mod
This is a mod for Mindustry that adds an assortment of "random", but useful stuff to the game.
In this mod, I am aiming to add turrets, real world stuff like tanks, nuclear weaponry, oil power generators, trebucet, and more, in the future. I do want to keep all the stuff I would like to do in one mod to make it simple, in terms of amount of mods, even though a good portion of the things that may go into the mod may not make sense to add together.
